0,1436,Plasma Diagnostics and Plasma-Surface Interactions in Inductively Coupled Plasmas,"Titus, Monica Joy","Graves, David B;",2010,"The semiconductor industry's continued trend of manufacturing device features on the nanometer scale requires increased plasma processing control and improved understanding of plasma characteristics and plasma-surface interactions. This dissertation presents a series of experimental results for focus studies conducted in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system. First novel ""on-wafer"" diagnostic tools are characterized and related to plasma characteristics. Second, plasma-polymer interactions are characterized as a function of plasma species and processing parameters. Complimentary simulations accompany each focus study to supplement experimental findings.Wafer heating mechanisms in inductively coupled molecular gas plasmas are explored with PlasmaTempTM, a novel ""on-wafer"" diagnostic tool. Experimental wafer measurements are obtained with the PlasmaTempTM wafer processed in argon (Ar) and argon-oxygen (Ar/O2) mixed plasmas. Wafer heating mechanisms were determined by combining the experimental measurements with a 3-dimensional heat transfer model of the wafer.  Comparisons between pure Ar and Ar/O2 plasmas demonstrate that two additional wafer heating mechanisms can be important in molecular gas plasmas compared to atomic gas discharges.  Thermal heat conduction from the neutral gas and O-atom recombination on wafer surface can contribute as much as 60 % to wafer heating under conditions of low-energy ion bombardment in molecular plasmas.Measurements of a second novel ""on-wafer"" diagnostic sensor, the PlasmaVoltTM, were tested and validated in the ICP system for Ar plasmas varying in power and pressure. Sensor measurements were interpreted with a numerical sheath simulation and comparison to scaling laws derived from the inhomogeneous sheath model. The study demonstrates sensor measurements are proportional to the RF-current through the sheath and the scaling is a function of sheath impedance. PlasmaVoltTM sensor measurements are proportional to the square root of the plasma density at the plasma-sheath interface, one-fourth root of the electron temperature, and one-fourth root of the RF bias voltage under conditions where the sheath is predominantly capacitive. When the sheath impedance becomes increasingly resistive, the sensor measurements deviate from the scaling law and tend to be directly proportional to the plasma density. Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) emissions in Ar ICPs are characterized and the chemical and physical modifications to 193 nm photoresist (PR) polymer materials processed in Ar ICPs are investigated. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) transmission measurements as a function of VUV photon fluence demonstrate that VUV-induced bond breaking occurs over a period of time.  A numerical model demonstrates that VUV photons deplete near-surface O-containing bonds, leading to deeper, subsequent penetration and more bond losses, while the remaining near-surface C-C bonds absorb the incident radiation and slow VUV photon penetration. The roughening mechanism of blanket and patterned 193 nm PR samples are explored in a well characterized Ar ICP.  FTIR and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis of plasma processed 193 nm PR suggests that ion-induced generation of a graphitized layer at high energies, combined with VUV bulk modification of 193 nm PR may initiate PR roughening. The roughness of blanket samples increases as a function of VUV fluence, ion energy, and substrate temperature.  Line width roughness (LWR) measurements of patterned samples demonstrate a similar trend suggesting that LWR may correlate with surface roughness of patterns. The results are compared to PR studies previously conducted in an ultra-high vacuum beam system demonstrating that the vacuum beam system is a useful tool that can deconvolute and simplify complex plasma systems.",ucb,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0hn5z4f1,eng,REGULAR,0,0
1,1437,Declarative Systems,"Condie, Tyson","Hellerstein, Joseph M;",2011,"Building system software is a notoriously complex and arduous endeavor.Developing tools and methodologies for practical system software engineeringhas long been an active area of research.  This thesis explores system softwaredevelopment through the lens of a declarative, data-centric programminglanguage that can succinctly express high-level system specifications and bedirectly compiled to executable code.  By unifying specification andimplementation, our approach avoids the common problem of implementationsdiverging from specifications over time.  In addition, we show that using adeclarative language often results in drastic reductions in code size (100Ã— andmore) relative to procedural languages like Java and C++.  We demonstrate theseadvantages by implementing a host of functionalities at various levels of thesystem hierarchy, including network protocols, query optimizers, and schedulingpolicies.  In addition to providing a compact and optimized implementation, wedemonstrate that our declarative implementations often map very naturally totraditional specifications: in many cases they are line-by-line translations ofpublished pseudcode.We started this work with the hypothesis that declarative languages --originally developed for the purposes of data management and querying -- couldbe fruitfully adapted to the specification and implementation of core systeminfrastructure.  A similar argument had been made for networking protocols afew years earlier [61].  However, our goals were quite different: we wanted toexplore a broader range of algorithms and functionalities (dynamic programming,scheduling, program rewriting, and system auditing) that were part of complex,real-world software systems.  We identified two existing system components --query optimizers in a DBMS and task schedulers in a cloud computing system --that we felt would be better specified via a declarative language.  Given ourinterest in delivering real-world software, a key challenge was identifying theright system boundary that would permit meaningful declarative implementationsto coexist within existing imperative system architectures.  We found thatrelations were a natural boundary for maintaining the ongoing system state onwhich the imperative and declarative code was based, and provided an elegantway to model system architectures.This thesis explores the boundaries of declarative systems via two projects.We begin with Evita Raced; an extensible compiler for the Overlog language usedin our declarative networking system, P2.  Evita Raced is a metacompiler -- anOverlog compiler written in Overlog -- that integrates seamlessly with the P2dataflow architecture.  We first describe the minimalist design of Evita Raced,including its extensibility interfaces and its reuse of the P2 data model andruntime engine.  We then demonstrate that a declarative language like Overlogis well-suited to expressing traditional and novel query optimizations as wellas other program manipulations, in a compact and natural fashion.  FollowingEvita Raced, we describe the initial work in BOOM Analytics, which began as alarge-scale experiment at building ""cloud"" software in a declarative language.Specifically, we used the Overlog language to implement a ""Big Data"" analyticsstack that is API-compatible with the Hadoop MapReduce architecture andprovides comparable performance.  We extended our declarative version of Hadoopwith complex distributed features that remain absent in the stock Hadoop Javaimplementation, including alternative scheduling policies, online aggregation,continuous queries, and unique monitoring and debugging facilities.  We presentquantitative and anecdotal results from our experience, providing concreteevidence that both data-centric design and declarative languages cansubstantially simplify systems programming.",ucb,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0sn1r9st,eng,REGULAR,0,0
2,1438,Portrait of the Rugged Individualist: The Nonverbal Pride Display Communicates Support for Meritocracy,"Horberg, Elizabeth Jane","Keltner, Dacher;",2010,"Emotions profoundly influence beliefs about morality and justice (Haidt, 2001) and emerging research suggests that expressions of emotion communicate an individual's moral attributes to others (e.g., Brown, Palameta, & Moore, 2002). The present research examines the moral beliefs signaled by the nonverbal pride display. Pride is triggered by appraisals that the self merits high status and greater access to resources (Tracy & Robins, 2004) and pride's nonverbal expression has been shown to convey these appraisals to observers (Shariff & Tracy, 2009). Guided by appraisal-tendency frameworks of the association between distinct emotions and moral beliefs (Horberg, Oveis, & Keltner, 2010), I predicted that the nonverbal expression of pride would communicate greater support for meritocracy--the belief that social and material resources ought to be distributed according to merit--relative to egalitarianism, or beliefs that resources ought to be distributed in ways that promote equality of outcomes. Study 1 demonstrated these effects using unfamiliar male and female targets posing pride or joy in photographs. Study 2 found that individuals previously shown a photo of Barack Obama expressing pride, relative to a neutral expression, subsequently rated Obama as more likely to endorse meritocracy. Finally, Study 3 tests the validity of pride-based inferences of support for meritocracy. This study demonstrated that individuals who spontaneously expressed pride to a greater degree were more likely to advocate dividing a resource between the self and another on the basis of merit rather than equally. Moreover, consistent with Studies 1 and 2, observers rated the high-pride expressers as more likely to support meritocracy and less likely to support egalitarianism.",ucb,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0v37d9g2,eng,REGULAR,0,0
3,1439,Essays in Empirical Macroeconomics,"Nelson Mondragon, John Alexander","Gorodnichenko, Yuriy;",2015,"This dissertation provides evidence on the eï¬€ects of changes in the supply of credit to households during the 2000s on employment and other outcomes of interest during the 2000s. In the ï¬rst chapter I study the eï¬€ects of contractions in household credit supply during the ï¬nancial crisis of 2007-2009. I exploit a countyâ€™s exposure to the collapse of a large and previously healthy lender as a natural experiment. I show that exposure to this shock appears to be uncorrelated with other important shocks at the time. Reduced form estimates suggest that this shock had large eï¬€ects on the ï¬‚ow of credit, housing and non-housing expenditures, and employment. Using exposure to this shock as an instrument gives an estimated elasticity of employment with respect to household credit of about 0.3, caused by declines in both housing and non-housing demand. In the second chapter I study the size of the credit supply shock using non-parametric methods. I identify lender-speciï¬c supply-side shocks, which I then aggregate into a simple  measure of credit supply shocks to counties. I provide conditions under which this measured shock can be used to quantify the importance of supply shocks to credit in both the cross-section and, in a partial equilibrium sense, the aggregate. Combining this measure with various estimates of the elasticity of employment with respect to the measure, I calculate that shocks to household credit can be responsible for 30 to 60% of the decline in employment from 2007 to 2010.",ucb,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0wh0h5bj,eng,REGULAR,0,0
4,1440,Control and Trajectory Generation of a Wearable Mobility Exoskeleton for Spinal Cord Injury Patients,"Swift, Timothy Alan","Kazerooni, Homayoon;",2011,"There are currently nearly 1.3 million people in the United States who have some form of lower extremity paralysis due to a spinal cord injury (SCI).  For many of these subjects, a wheelchair is their primary means of mobility which brings along with it a collection of health complications stemming from extended periods of time in a seated position.  To provide these SCI patients with a viable upright mobility option, this work presents the control structure and trajectory generation method for a mobility exoskeleton that allows them to ambulate while reliably generating a gait similar to that of an unimpaired subject.  Also included are theoretical extensions to the trajectory generation structure and results from initial rounds of subject testing.",ucb,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0xc9q3b6,eng,REGULAR,0,0
5,1441,Errors as a Productive Context for Classroom Discussions: A Longitudinal Analysis of Norms in a Classroom Community,"Leveille Buchanan, Nicole Therese","Saxe, Geoffrey;",2016,"How do teachers and students create classroom environments in which mathematical errors are regarded as important opportunities for learning?  What norms support students in learning from their errors, and how to these norms develop in a classroom community?  This dissertation addresses these questions through a longitudinal case study investigating the emergence of classroom norms related to the treatment of errors.  Classroom norms are here understood to be taken-as-shared expectations for behavior in a classroom. The fifth-grade case study classroom was selected because in prior research studies the experienced and highly-regarded teacher had engaged students in rich discussions of their mathematical errors and the opportunities presented by these errors for learning.  To answer the questions of (a) what norms related to mathematical errors were taken up, and (b) how these norms developed over the course of the school year, Saxeâ€™s (2012) framework describing the relation of micro-, onto-, and sociogenetic processes was used as a guide for determining methods.  Sociogenetic processes were the focus of this investigation, and Saxeâ€™s framework points to microgenetic constructions, when studied collectively over time, as likely to illuminate otherwise difficult to observe sociogenetic processes, such as norm development.  To provide information about microgenetic constructions related to errors, several types of evidence were collected throughout the school year during three data collection periods lasting two weeks each: at the beginning (September), middle (January), and end (April) of the 2014 to 2015 school year.  During all three time periods, the teacher was interviewed, five â€œfocalâ€ students were interviewed, classroom mathematics lessons were video-recorded daily, and all students in the classroom answered a paper-and-pencil multiple choice survey about their expectations related to errors. Interviews were analyzed using grounded analysis methods, and video-recordings were analyzed using a focused coding procedure and StudioCode software.  Sources of evidence were used in a triangulating fashion to identify norms in the classroom.Through this analysis, seven norms were identified as having been taken up by the majority of members of the class by the end-of-year data collection period. Two of these norms were selected for in-depth description. The norm everyone has some mathematical understandings to which you should pay attention provides a good example of a norm that was closely tied to a specific collective practice, the â€œcoachingâ€ practice that was used frequently in the case-study classroom.  The norm there are different types of errors, only some of which are acceptable provides an example of a norm that emerged part-way through the school year in response to a problem with the way errors were being treated.  Classroom interactions and teacher and student interview statements exemplifying these norms are described. The process through which these two norms emerged in the case study classroom over the course of the school year is detailed, using evidence collected throughout the school year.  In general, the teacher strongly promoted these norms by frequently and persistently modeling, describing, and praising behaviors consistent with these norms and by correcting inconsistent behaviors. Implications for how Saxeâ€™s framework may be productively applied in future investigations of classrooms norms are discussed.  In particular, attention to ontogenetic processes â€“ that is, individualsâ€™ shifting expectations over time â€“ was found to be useful as an access point for identifying the norms of a classroom community, and the teacherâ€™s actions and expectations were found to be especially important indicators of classroom norms.  Examination of collective practices related to errors was also useful for the identification of norms because some norms were strongly associated with collective practices, such as the â€œcoachingâ€ practice.  The results of this study also have implications for teaching practice.  The findings indicate that children are capable of taking up challenging practices related to the study of errors, and teachers who promote these practices in their classrooms may be successful if they are persistent in modeling, explaining, and praising the desired practices.",ucb,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0zz775v7,eng,REGULAR,0,0
6,1442,Interrogating the Role of Spatial Organization in Receptor Function: Eph-Ephrin Signaling in Breast Cancer,"Nair, Pradeep","Groves, Jay T.;",2010,"Cells in living tissue integrate multiple signals from their environment to govern numerous aspects of both healthy and diseased behavior.  The cell membrane serves as an exquisite functional filter that regulates information transmission between a cell and its surrounding environment.  This viscoelastic plasma membrane, which allows lateral diffusion while restricting the orientation of signaling molecules within the plane of a phospholipid bilayer, is uniquely well suited to make sense of the myriad biochemical, mechanical, and spatial cues that constantly stimulate receptors on the cell surface.  The chemical basis for the cell membrane, a fluid phospholipid bilayer, can be used to create a supported membrane that retains these properties while allowing precise control over the physical and chemical aspects of signaling molecules on the supported membrane surface.Cell communication is critical for proper maintenance of multicellular organisms, and tumorigenesis can occur when communication is not properly controlled.  Cancerous cells often display a vastly altered array of cell surface receptors compared to normal cells, and the abnormal signaling that these receptors trigger has grave consequences for the fate of the cell and the organism as a whole.  The dynamics by which these receptors bind to ligands within the environment are not well understood because the cell membrane is a chemically heterogeneous and physically irregular surface that is difficult to study in vivo.  Here we recapitulate signaling events that occur in live cancer cells using the supported membrane to present laterally mobile ligands to receptor-expressing human breast cancer cells.This platform allows for precise control of the spatial organization of signaling molecules on the supported membrane surface, as well as a detailed examination of subsequent changes in signaling events within living cells.  Using this approach we observe receptor reorganization responses that are strongly linked to tissue invasion and our observations reveal a mechanism by which cells respond to the spatial and mechanical aspects of their environment.",ucb,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1117n3zf,eng,REGULAR,0,0
7,1443,Hydrodynamic Exchange in Estuarine Perimeter Habitats,"HSU, KEVIN KAI-WIN","Stacey, Mark T.;",2013,"Hydrodynamic exchange in estuaries is forced by tides, freshwater input, density forcing, and winds, and controls transport of important quantities such as salinity, sediment, nutrients, and pollutants.  Previous work has characterized many aspects of estuarine transport and contributed to our understanding of transport mechanisms such as gravitational exchange, tidal dispersion processes, and residual flows due to tidal asymmetries.  In general, studies of estuarine transport have focused on large-scale transport processes in the along-channel direction of the estuary, which determine the overall salinity and flow structure in estuarine environments.  However, study of hydrodynamic exchange at the perimeter of estuaries has also been recognized to be important, as exchange at the perimeter is relevant for understanding questions related to environmental restoration and management and ecological habitat quality.In this work, hydrodynamic exchange in estuaries and perimeter habitats is studied using numerical modeling and field observations of South San Francisco Bay.  First, the exchange between the estuary and a small perimeter slough is measured using salinity and temperature as tracers to calculate hydrodynamic flushing of the slough through tidal exchange, using a modified tidal prism method.  This method applies quasi-Lagrangian analysis to Eulerian measurements of exchange, and the results are compared to previous results from larger-scale estuarine systems, where tidal flushing is found to be significantly affected by the scale of mixing volumes in the system.  Next, Lagrangian methods of particle-tracking and Lagrangian coherent structure (LCS) analysis, developed from dynamical systems theory in order to analyze complex, chaotic flows, are applied to analyze tidal transport.  The results reveal the significant effects of tidal interactions with perimeter estuarine features on Lagrangian tidal transport over the tidal cycle, where perimeter interactions are found to significantly contribute to longitudinal estuarine dispersion.  Finally, the effect of wind forcing on estuarine transport is examined, using Lagrangian analysis methods applied to cases of constant wind forcing with varying wind direction relative to the main axis of the estuary.  Wind forcing is found to have a significant effect on hydrodynamic exchange and connectivity between the estuary and perimeter habitats, where wind in all directions increases perimeter exchange and connectivity, with the greatest effect for winds aligned with the along-axis direction of the estuary.  The results of these studies are relevant to a wide range of applications requiring analysis of connectivity near the estuarine perimeter, including sediment exchange and transport and seagrass population colonization in the context of wetland habitat restoration.",ucb,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/11r7t98v,eng,REGULAR,0,0
8,1444,An Environmental and Economic Trade-off Analysis of Manufacturing Process Chains to Inform Decision Making for Sustainability,"Robinson, Stefanie","Dornfeld, David A;",2013,"Increasing costs, consumer awareness, and environmental legislation have driven industry to reduce its resource consumption and the impact from that consumption.  So, both traditional economic objectives (e.g., cost, time, and quality) and environmental objectives (e.g., CO2 emissions) have become strategically relevant for the manufacturing sector. For many manufacturing companies, production systems have a major influence on the environmental footprint of a product and therefore represent a major opportunity to minimize the company's overall environmental impact. Currently within industry, there is not an accurate, effective, or widely accepted method to assess the resource consumption of process chains used to manufacture a product.  As a result, this information is often not considered when making decisions about what processes to use. A considerable part of the energy and resource demand in manufacturing is determined during production planning.  An important component of this planning is determining the process chains to be used.  Process chains are a combined sequence of specifically arranged, single processes used to manufacture a product. As manufacturing processes are very resource intensive, it is now necessary to assess the resource consumption as well as the economics of these process chains.  Because of this, additional information must be considered when selecting the process chains used to manufacture a product.     Many life cycle assessment (LCA) tools focus on the materials and final disposition of a product, but do not include detailed information or data on the manufacturing required to fabricate the product. Sustainability impacts of discrete manufacturing processes and product value streams are needed to develop more complete LCAs. The development of a methodology and user tool to quantify sustainability impacts, leading to the identification of gaps and opportunities, is essential to facilitate decision making to support sustainability in manufacturing facilities.     To address these issues, this dissertation proposes an approach to evaluate and quantify the resource use in addition to the environmental and economic impacts associated with discrete manufacturing processes as part of a complex process chain. A methodology to evaluate multiple process chain configurations will be presented.       First, a database of industrial assessment metrics was compiled.  This database allows users to sort and select from a list of key metrics in order to choose the metrics that are relevant for the performance that they want to measure.  Next, an industrial assessment methodology was developed.  This methodology gives users an overview of the key areas to address when conducting an industrial assessment.  This methodology, which was applied to three case studies, can be used in combination with the key metrics.      In the second part of the dissertation, a resource consumption assessment and mapping methodology for complex manufacturing process chains was developed. This systematic methodology was developed to identify and quantify the resource consumption (energy, water, materials) for discrete manufacturing processes.  The processes mapped include: welding (manual and robotic), cutting (plasma arc and laser), rework (air carbon arc cutting and hand grinding), and machining (milling).      Next, a model consisting of database modules for each process was developed. This model quantifies the sustainability impacts (energy, water, and material consumption, waste generation, emissions, and resource consumption cost) of manufacturing process chains.  The model was validated using a case study with Caterpillar Inc. for a process chain including welding, plasma arc cutting, laser cutting, and milling.       Next, a process chain assessment tool was created.  This tool enables manufacturers to assess the resource consumption and associated impacts of multiple fabrication process chain configurations. This enables a more comprehensive assessment compared to other software tools.  Finally, a methodology modeled after the Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) process was presented to show how to translate the results from the model and tool to an Environmental Value Stream Map and to translate those results into improvements in manufacturing systems. This methodology was validated on a machining operation in a Caterpillar facility.         This research has developed and evaluated an effective approach for the analysis of energy, water, and other resource use in multiple processes in a manufacturing process chain.  This allows manufacturers to better understand the resource consumption and environmental and economic impacts of fabrication process chains used to make a product. This dissertation helps to provide the technical understanding and tools to enable designers and manufacturing engineers to create manufacturing systems that are truly more sustainable.  The implementation of this work can be directly applied to assessing and optimizing manufacturing process chains and the work presented in this dissertation directly contributes to the realization of a sustainable and prosperous manufacturing sector.",ucb,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1513r3t9,eng,REGULAR,0,0
9,1445,Essays on Markets and Institutions in Emerging Economies,"GHANI, TAREK FOUAD","Tadelis, Steven;Dal Bo, Ernesto;",2015,"Market frictions pervade emerging economies and constrain private sector development. In such settings, formal institutions to help address contract enforcement, property rights and information asymmetries are typically weak or absent. Instead, market participants must rely on informal practices and institutions to mitigate uncertainty, instability and opportunism. For example, personalized exchange relationships are useful when contract enforcement is weak, and cash holdings can be attractive when financial institutions are unreliable. In three specific emerging economy settings, I explore how informal practices and institutions interact with formal market development, and in particular the role that market frictions play in determining outcomes for firms, technologies and employees. The first chapter of this dissertation explores how changes in formal upstream market structure affect the economics of downstream relationships using original data from the ice industry in Sierra Leone. In this setting, a monopoly ice manufacturer sells through independent retailers to fishermen buyers. I demonstrate that a shock that increases upstream competition among manufacturers improves the contractual terms offered by retailers to buyers.  Under the monopoly manufacturer, late deliveries are common due to outside demand shocks. To help mitigate this uncertainty, retailers prioritize loyal customers when faced with shortages, and buyers respond by rarely switching retailers. When manufacturers compete, prices fall, quantities increase and services improve with fewer late deliveries. Entry upstream also disrupts collusion among retailers by increasing the value of competing for buyer relationships. Competing retailers expand trade credit provision as a new basis for loyalty, and stable buyer relationships reemerge after a period of intense switching. The findings suggest that market structure shapes informal contractual institutions, and that competition can reconstitute the nature of relationships.  The second chapter addresses the relationship between violence and financial decisions in Afghanistan. In particular, I investigate how violence affects the tradeoff between informal cash holdings - which are liquid but insecure - and usage of a more secure but less liquid formal financial account. Using three separate data sources, I find that individuals experiencing violence retain more cash and are less likely to adopt and use mobile money, a new financial technology. First, combining detailed information on the entire universe of mobile money transactions in Afghanistan with administrative records for all violent incidents recorded by international forces, I find a negative relationship between violence and mobile money use. Second, in the context of a randomized control trial, violence is associated with decreased mobile money use and greater cash balances. Third, in financial survey data from nineteen of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, I find that individuals experiencing violence hold more cash. Collectively, the evidence indicates that individuals experiencing violence prefer cash to mobile money. More speculatively, it appears that this is principally because of concerns about future violence. These results emphasize the difficulty of creating robust financial networks in conflict settings.Finally, in the third chapter, I study how informal behaviors interact with incentives to affect employees' decisions to formally save in the context of a large firm in Afghanistan. I analyze a mobile phone-based account that allows savings to be automatically deducted from salaries. Employees who are automatically enrolled in this defined-contribution account are 40 percentage points more likely to contribute than individuals with a default contribution of zero. Analyzing randomly assigned employer matching contributions, I find that the effect of automatic enrollment on participation is approximately equivalent to providing financial incentives equal to a 50 percent match. To understand why default enrollment increases participation, some employees are randomly offered an immediate financial consultation, and others a financial consultation in one week. Employees are more likely to discuss changing their savings contributions in one week, suggesting that defaults raise contributions because of the perceived complexity of financial decisions, and because employees procrastinate in developing a financial plan for the future.",ucb,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/15g1g7dv,eng,REGULAR,0,0
10,1446,A Nexus Between Two Disruptions: A Multiscale Analysis of Transportation Electrification to Forecast the Impacts of Vehicle Grid Integration,"Sheppard, Colin John Ritter","Walker, Joan;",2019,"In this dissertation, I present a body of work that advances our understanding of the technical and economic potential for vehicle grid integration based on a variety of methodological approaches that quantify the opportunity at multiple scales, across multiple geographies, and that cover scenarios with both personally owned plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs). The key research questions addressed in this dissertation include:* How can charging infrastructure be cost-effectively deployed to maximize utilization and value to PEV drivers?* How much flexibility exists in the charging demand from PEVs? * What is the economic opportunity to manage the charging of PEVs to occur at lower cost time periods?* How will fleets of electrified autonomous vehicles serving mobility on-demand differ in how they are managed to minimize the cost of charging or to serve as a source of electricity for buildings?These questions are motivated by the fact that transportation electrification and emerging forms of mobility are dramatically changing how the transportation system is planned, operated, and analyzed. PEVs present new challenges and constraints around the siting and operation of refueling infrastructure. Electric load from PEVs can exacerbate grid congestion at either transmission or distribution scales if left unmanaged. Sharing and autonomy are changing mobility which will have unique implications for the grid integration of PEVs. Meanwhile, there are strong social and environmental forces compelling planners, regulators, and private industry to electrify transportation as soon as possible. The transportation sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the United States. With the exception of the great recession, emissions in the transportation sector have been growing for the last three decades, in contrast to the electric power and industrial sectors which have been on a downward trend in emissions. Transportation, therefore, represents one of the primary challenges to achieving deep decarbonization of the U.S. economy.In the electric power sector, policy and economic forces are upending incumbent generation technologies (coal and natural gas) in favor of lower cost and lower carbon alternatives, particularly wind and solar power. As these intermittent renewable resources increase in capacity, the incidence of renewable energy (RE) curtailment increases due to time periods when supply is greater than demand and generators are turned down or shut off from the level that they would otherwise be producing. Curtailment raises the overall system cost of supplying electricity. In addition, some utilities must meet an energy production standard to satisfy state mandates for renewable production. Renewable curtailment forces utilities to either acquire more RE or introduce sources of grid flexibility to relieve the curtailment. One low cost strategy to mitigate these challenges is to manage the temporal profile of electricity demand to make use of the renewable resources when they are available.PEVs are generally analyzed through modeling using one of two approaches, statistical modeling and activity-based modeling. Statistical models typically summarize or infer travel patterns from travel survey data and use them to characterize the need for PEV charging and the temporal opportunities to charge. The key disadvantage of such approaches is that they cannot account for the individual mobility constraints of travelers and they typically require an assumption that charging infrastructure is unlimited. Another common approach is to develop Markov Chain models of mobility and PEV charging. In these models, transitions between states are treated as random events. Because they lack a representation of the causal mechanism for these transitions, these models are difficult to generalize and their utility is degraded if applied in prospective contexts assuming a transportation system with dramatically different characteristics than present. Activity-based models make use of travel diaries from surveys or GPS data logging which are then provided as input to mobility and charging simulations. Agent-based models are a subset of activity-based models, in so far as they treat travelers individually and require a representation of each individual's activity schedule in order to model the travel necessary to engage in those activities. What distinguishes agent-based models are two key features: 1) wrapping the individuals in a virtual environment (e.g. the transportation system) with detailed representation of transportation supply and 2) dynamically simulating the agents' interactions with the virtual environment and with each other. These interactions open the opportunity to model the choices of the agents based on empirical studies of human behavior as well as to make agent behavior contingent on the time-evolving state of their environment and other agents.In the electric power and grid modeling domain, load from PEVs are typically represented as static or derived from very rudimentary estimation techniques. Studies either ignore flexibility entirely or they make simplistic assumptions about the timing and degree to which PEV load can be shaped. The inaccuracy in these modeling choices have had a relatively low impact in the recent past due to the still relatively low penetration of PEVs in the national vehicle fleet. But within a decade it will no longer suffice to ignore or simplify PEV load, which could eventually make up more than 20% of U.S. electricity demand.This dissertation addresses these gaps by coupling models of electric mobility and the grid at multiple scales. Each paper presented in this dissertation was produced in collaboration with co-authors across multiple projects and contexts. I employ reduced-form models in the context of optimization to solve the charger scheduling and vehicle mobility problems, as well as detailed agent-based models that simulate context-specific traveler behaviors and the dynamics of resource-constrained charging infrastructure.To address the infrastructure siting problem, I develop a spatially explicit agent-based simulation model that represents charging infrastructure, charging behavior, competition for scarce chargers, and driver adaptation. A differential evolution and a heuristic optimization scheme are employed to find a cost-effective distribution of charging infrastructure. I then address the question of flexibility in two ways. First I develop a scheme for optimizing the charging profiles of individual PEV drivers based an objective that simultaneously considers the costs of charging and the benefits associated with providing ancillary services to the grid. Then I employ a much higher fidelity approach to simulate both the electrified mobility system as well as the power sector. I develop the BEAM modeling framework (Behavior, Energy, Mobility, and Autonomy), which is an agent-based model of PEV mobility and charging behavior designed as an extension to MATSim (the Multi-Agent Transportation Simulation model). I apply BEAM to the San Francisco Bay Area and conduct a preliminary calibration and validation of its prediction of charging load based on observed charging infrastructure utilization for the region in 2016.  I link the BEAM model with PLEXOS, an industry standard production cost model that accurately characterizes grid dispatch constraints.Finally, I consider the impact of grid-integrated fleets of SAEVs providing mobility on-demand. In two separate studies I develop models to consider how such fleets could be used to serve building energy demand during power outages as well as a more general analysis of the battery and charging infrastructure requirements to serve nationwide mobility.The key findings across all of this work are the following:* In today's energy markets, PEV flexibility can reach values of $155/year/vehicle for NYISO and $98/year/vehicle for CAISO. The annual cost savings due to optimizing dispatch come more from savings on the price of energy (74% in CAISO and 61% in NYISO) but providing ancillary services (in the form of regulation) also contributes value to the solution (26% in CAISO and 39% in NYISO).* When we project the energy market of California to a future year when renewables make up 50% of the annual energy produced, PEV flexibility is even more beneficial to the power sector, primarily in lowering grid operating cost and the amount of RE that must be curtailed to avoid over-generation when supply and demand are mismatched. For example, if treated as flexible loads, 2.5 million smart charging PEVs avoid 50\% of incremental system operating costs annually and reduce renewable energy curtailment by 27% annually relative to when the same number of unmanaged charging PEVs are added to the grid. * When SAEVs serve power to buildings during an extreme outage, the fleet can generate 32%-40% more revenue than is earned serving mobility alone. While the overall value of providing on-demand power depends on the frequency and severity of power outages, the results show that serving power demand during large-scale outages can provide a substantial value stream, comparable to what can be earned providing grid services. * All mobility in the United States currently served by 276 million personally owned vehicles could be served by 12.5 million SAEVs at a cost of $0.27/vehicle-mile or $0.18/passenger-mile. The energy requirements for this fleet would be 1142 GWh/day (8.5% of 2017 U.S. electricity demand) and the peak charging load 76.7 GW (11% of U.S. power peak). In total, this body of work contributes new insights into the opportunity for electric mobility to reduce the cost of operating the electric grid, enabling deeper and faster adoption of renewable power in the electric sector, and providing reliable mobility to travelers in the transportation sector. The domain of vehicle grid integration is still relatively new, there are many areas of research that require additional attention, such as increased research on traveler preferences around PEV charging, the intersection between electric mobility and the distribution grid, electrification of medium and heavy duty vehicles, as well as properly incentivizing electric vehicles to ride hail drivers in the gig economy.",ucb,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1663f91r,eng,REGULAR,0,0
